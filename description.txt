Welcome to Animation Studio!

!!! Disclaimer: This mod effectively does nothing without integration of other mods !!!

The intended use of this mod is to aid developers in creating animations using keyframes. Use Cheats to get the Item 'AnimatorWrench' to access the UI.

To use this mod effectively, use the mod calls "RegisterElement" and/or "RegisterControl" to register your element (filter) and the controls (fields/variables). The given element will now be available for selection in the UI. When your element is selected it will show all the registered controls in the grid.

Use the additional arguments of the "RegisterControl" mod call to specify the value, range, step size, format and conversion types.

Use the mod call "AnimationValue" with the appropriate element and control names to pass the value of your field/variable into Animation Studio. 
- In read mode: Animation Studio will read the given value and save it internally. It returns the unmodified value.
- In Write mode: Animation Studio will ignore the given value and return its internal value instead.

When the incorrect filter is selected it will not read/write anything; it will return the given value.

Some fun facts:

This mod was made to make animations for my work in progress 'Stars Above' addon mod. Due to popular demand in their Discord server I decided to split it from the addon and make it a standalone mod. So... it comes with built-in 'Stars Above' support.

Happy animating!
